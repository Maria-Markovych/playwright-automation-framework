# Playwright Automation Framework

[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/Maria-Markovych/playwright-automation-framework/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Maria-Markovych/playwright-automation-framework/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

A scalable end-to-end test automation framework built with **Playwright and TypeScript**.

The project demonstrates UI and API test automation using a layered architecture with Page Object Model, reusable UI components, custom fixtures, API service classes, test data management, network mocking, Allure reporting, and GitHub Actions CI.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Playwright** — UI and API test automation
* **TypeScript** — strongly typed test development
* **Allure** — test reporting
* **dotenv** — environment configuration
* **GitHub Actions** — CI execution
* **Page Object Model** — UI abstraction
* **REST API testing** — API service layer and typed models

## Test Coverage

### UI Testing

The UI test suite covers:

* User authentication
* User registration
* Product details
* Product search
* Product filtering by category
* Shopping cart
* Adding products to the cart
* Removing products from the cart
* Product quantity management
* Checkout flow
* Contact Us form

### API Testing

The API test suite covers:

* Products API
* Brands API
* Login API
* Account creation
* Account details
* Account deletion
* API response validation
* Negative scenarios

### Network Mocking

The project demonstrates Playwright network interception using:

* `route.fulfill()` — mock server responses
* `route.continue()` — modify requests before sending them
* `route.abort()` — abort network requests and verify failure handling

### Reporting

* Allure reporting
* Playwright HTML report
* Screenshots on failure
* Video recording on failure
* Traces for debugging

---

## Architecture

The framework follows a layered architecture designed to keep test scenarios readable and implementation details isolated.

### UI Layer

The UI automation layer is based on the Page Object Model and separates test scenarios from UI implementation details.

```text
Tests
  ↓
Pages
  ↓
Components / Containers / Widgets
  ↓
Playwright Locators
```

Tests focus on user behaviour, while page objects and reusable UI components contain interaction logic.

---

### API Layer

API tests use a layered service-based architecture.

```text
Tests
  ↓
Services
  ↓
API Client
  ↓
Endpoints
  ↓
API
```

The API layer includes:

* reusable API client;
* centralized endpoints;
* service classes;
* typed request models;
* typed response models;
* API fixtures.

This structure keeps API tests focused on business behaviour rather than request construction details.

---

## Fixtures

Custom Playwright fixtures provide reusable test setup and dependencies.

### UI Fixtures

Examples:

```text
loggedHomePage
loggedCartPage
loggedContactUsPage
```

The `loggedHomePage` fixture provides a ready-to-use authenticated page object.

UI tests can focus on test scenarios without repeating browser context and authentication setup.

### API Fixtures

API fixtures provide reusable service instances such as:

```text
productsService
loginService
accountService
```

This allows API tests to work directly with service methods.

---

## Test Data Management

Test data is separated from test implementation.

```text
test-data/
├── api/
├── files/
└── ui/
```

The framework also uses factories to create reusable and configurable test objects.

This approach helps to:

* reduce hardcoded values in tests;
* improve readability;
* reuse test data;
* simplify data maintenance.

---

## Authentication

The framework uses Playwright authentication state to reuse authenticated sessions across UI tests.

Authentication is prepared during the setup project and the generated storage state is stored locally in:

```text
playwright/.auth/
```

The authentication state is excluded from version control.

Authenticated UI fixtures can then reuse this state without repeating the login flow before every test.

---

## Network Mocking

The project contains dedicated examples demonstrating Playwright network interception capabilities.

The examples cover:

* completely mocking a server response;
* modifying a request before it is sent;
* aborting a network request;
* verifying request failure handling.

These examples demonstrate different approaches to controlling network behaviour during automated tests.

---

## Environment Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration.

A template configuration file is provided:

```text
.env.example
```

To run the project locally, create a `.env` file based on this template.

Sensitive configuration and local environment files are excluded from version control.

---

## Installation

Install project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Install Playwright browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

---

## Running Tests

### Run all tests

```bash
npm run all
```

### Run UI tests

```bash
npm run uitests
```

### Run API tests

```bash
npm run apitests
```

### Run network mocking tests

```bash
npm run networktests
```

---

## Playwright Report

After test execution, the Playwright HTML report can be opened with:

```bash
npm run report
```

---

## Allure Report

Generate and open the Allure report with:

```bash
npm run allure
```

The report provides detailed information about:

* test execution results;
* test steps;
* severity;
* tags;
* failure details.

The Allure report provides both a high-level overview of the complete test execution and detailed information about individual test cases.

Test Execution Overview

The Overview section provides a summary of the test run, including the total number of tests and their execution results.
![Allure Test Execution Overview](./docs/images/allure-overview.png)

Test Details

The Behaviors section provides detailed information about individual tests, including test descriptions, tags, severity and other test metadata.

---

## CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated test execution.

The CI pipeline is configured to:

* install project dependencies;
* install Playwright browsers;
* execute automated tests;
* retry failed tests on CI;
* prevent accidental execution of `test.only`.

---

This project demonstrates practical experience in:

* UI and API test automation;
* Playwright and TypeScript;
* Page Object Model;
* layered framework architecture;
* reusable fixtures;
* API service abstraction;
* test data management;
* network mocking;
* Allure reporting;
* CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.
